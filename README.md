# Horiseon-Webpage

*My motivation was to apply my knowledge and experience to what the client requested in order to achieve a shared vision. This included meeting the client's expectation of making the application that follows accessibility standards and is more optimized for search-engines.
*The purpose of this project was to provide an accessible, user-friendly, and interactive application for the user. Also to make the HTML and CSS code semantically sound and coherent.
*We were able to meet accessibility standards by adding "alt" attirbutes to each image, which will improve the search engine ranking and overall SEO. 
*HTML and CSS were used in this project.
